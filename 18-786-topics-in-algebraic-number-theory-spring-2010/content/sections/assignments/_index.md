The problem sets for this course account for 50% of each student's grade. Students are encouraged to work on the homework in groups, but you must write up your own solutions.

| ASSIGNMENTS | HINTS |
| --- | --- |
| Problem set 1 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_pset01)) | &nbsp; |
| Problem set 2 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_pset02)) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} \- In problem 5, take an arbitrary element a + bu + cu^2 of Q (u) where u^3 = 2, with a,b,c in Q, and compute its characteristic polynomial from the definition. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} \- In problem 6, to produce an element of a quadratic subextension of the cyclotomic field, add the elements of an H-orbit of a suitable generator of the cyclotomic field, where H is a suitable subgroup of the Galois group G. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} \- In problem 7, if you haven't seen tensor products of modules before, see an algebra book (e.g. Lang or Hungerford), or the [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product_of_modules#Construction). {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| Problem set 3 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_pset03)) | &nbsp; |
| Problem set 4 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_pset04)) | &nbsp; |
| Problem set 5 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_pset05)) | &nbsp; |
| Problem set 6 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_pset06)) | Two fixes: In problem 1) assume the ideal $\\frak{a}$ is prime. In problem 6 you have to show U/U\_1 is cyclic, not U/U\_0 (which is trivial). A non-archimedean local field in the problems (and in this course) will always be a finite extension of $\\mathbb{Q}\_p$. |
| Problem set 7 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_pset07)) | &nbsp; |
| Problem set 8 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_pset08)) | &nbsp; |
| Problem set 9 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_pset09)) | &nbsp; |
| Problem set 10 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_pset10)) | &nbsp; |
| Problem set 11 ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_pset11)) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} \- For problem 6, the following gp functions may come in handy: polcompositum(f,g) returns polynomials defining the compositum(s) of the fields defined by the irreducible polynomials f and g. For F = nfinit(f) a number field, F.disc returns the discriminant of F. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} \- For problem 7, you may use gp to do factoring mod p, as usual. {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| Take-home final ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/assignments/mit18_786s10_exam)) | Problem 11: use a theorem we used early in class field theory which provides generators for a Galois group over Q. Also, see pg 95-96 of Samuel.
